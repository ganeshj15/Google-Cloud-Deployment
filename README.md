Deploying Machine Learning Model to classify IRIS Flower on GCP


This web application uses Machine Learning to Classify the IRIS Flower baseed on various variables like sepal length, sepal width, petal lengfth and petal width.The data set was loaded from sklearn library. Algorithm used is Logistic Regression for multi-classification.Then the  model in terms of pickle file is used here. This web app is built with python, flask, HTML and CSS.I used pycharm IDE for the development of this project. 

You cann check the classifier with the link https://iris-flower-classfication.el.r.appspot.com/ .

The classifier deployed on GCP will look as following.
